# hsk_flashcards
Program (in Rust) to generate Anki flashcards for the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (a Chinese language proficiency test).

You can download the deck created by this program [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1855818143).

To run this program, you must have an up-to-date installation of Rust.

Run ```./make_apkg.sh``` from the root directory; the output file will be stored at ```/tmp/deck.apkg```.

Note: this is my very first Rust program, and was created over the course of several late nights.
As such, the code quality may be lacking.
